# **Water Potability**

## **Project Introduction**
This project evaluates the potability of water using a dataset containing various water quality parameters. By analyzing these parameters, the project determines whether the water is safe (potable) for consumption or not.

The primary objective is to classify test samples based on their quality into two categories:
- **Potable (Safe for drinking)**  
- **Non-Potable (Unsafe for drinking)**  

This project aims to provide insights into water quality standards, supporting public health monitoring and environmental research.

## **Objectives**
- Analyze the impact of chemical and physical parameters (e.g., pH, hardness, solids, etc.) on water quality.
- Build and train a machine learning model to predict water potability.
- Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Interpret results to identify which parameters are most influential in determining water quality.

## **Tools & Technologies**
The project utilizes the following tools and technologies:

- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas` and `numpy` for data manipulation and analysis.
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization.
  - `scikit-learn` for machine learning model building and evaluation.
- **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebook for exploratory analysis and model development.
- **Version Control**: Git for tracking changes.
- **Deployment Tools (Optional)**: Streamlit or Flask for creating a user-friendly interface.
