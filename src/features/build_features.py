'''
6. Feature Creation
Mathematical Combinations: Combine existing features using arithmetic operations.
Domain-Specific Features: Create features based on domain knowledge.
Date/Time Features: Extract useful components like day, month, or weekday.
Lag Features: For time series data, create lag variables for temporal patterns.
Interaction Features: Combine two or more features to capture relationships.

7. Dimensionality Reduction
PCA (Principal Component Analysis): Reduce dimensionality while preserving variance.
t-SNE/UMAP: For visualizing high-dimensional data.
Autoencoders: Neural network-based reduction.
8. Feature Extraction
Text Data: Use methods like Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF, or word embeddings.
Image Data: Extract features using techniques like edge detection or pre-trained CNNs.
Time-Series Data: Extract statistical features (mean, variance) or frequency domain features (FFT).
9. Feature Engineering for Specific Models
Tailor features for specific algorithms (e.g., polynomial features for linear regression or embeddings for deep learning).
10. Feature Evaluation
Assess Feature Importance: Use models like Random Forest or SHAP values.
Iterative Improvement: Test and refine features iteratively.
11. Feature Storage
Save engineered features for reuse in training, testing, and production pipelines.
